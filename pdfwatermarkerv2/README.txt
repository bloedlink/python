This script lets you watermark all pfs in a folder, with a pdf that will serve as watermark. 
I have added a watermark pdf which can be used for testing purposes.  
the destination folder will be created if nonexisting, if it does exists it will just write in there. 

-The pdfs you want to watermark must be in the root folder where the script lives. 
parameter 1 = the pdf file you want to use as your watermark.
parameter 2 = the destination folder. 

E.G. python pdf_watermarker_v2 watermarkfile.pdf destinationfolder
